title: Introducing Sentry
---

If you want to learn a new hero you've never touched before, what do you to? You can go to Dotabuff
and look at what other people are doing. It shows which items they buy and in
what order they get their abilities, but it doesn't help with the **WHY**.
The why is very imporant, as many things in Dota are situational, and to improve
at the game has a lot to do with doing the right thing in the right situation.

There are a few other sites that offer guides. Most of them
allow users to submit their own guides, so there are many guides for each hero.
The problem with that is that you now have to decide which guide you read,
which is somewhat difficult because you don't know anything about the hero in the first
place, how will you know if something in the guide is wrong? Their authors also tend
to not keep their guides updated constantly, so even if a guide is highly rated, it
probably does not apply to the patch that was released last week.

Sentry is here to fix this situation. For each hero, there is exactly **one** guide.
Everyone can contribute to improve the guides, changes are then reviewed by our
core contributors. This should ensure they are of high quality and constantly updated
as Dota patches get released.

To make this possible, we need **YOUR** help! You can improve our guides or
write new ones. If you know a few things about web design, there is a lot to do in
that area, too.
