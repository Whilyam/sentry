## Contribute

Sentry is community driven, everyone can help improving it.

Creating and modifying Guides requires the
use of Git, Ruby and Markdown. If you have no idea what
I'm talking about - sorry, we might look into making things easier in the future.

Now, lets dive straight in. Sentry is built on top of the static site generator
[Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/). Everything you see here is Open Source and
on [GitHub](https://github.com/jgillich/sentry). All you have to do is to install
Middleman, download the source and you are ready to go.

#### Writing Guides

Guides live in `source/heroes`, and are `.md.erb` documents, basically they are
Markdown documents with some templating magic. To create a new guide, we first have
to look up the correct id for our hero. They are listed in `data/heroes.yml`.
Usually that is just the regular name in lowercase, with underscores as separators.

All guides start with a block called frontmatter, like this:

<pre>
---
title: Crystal Maiden Guide
hero: crystal_maiden
layout: hero
index: true
---
</pre>

It defines some general properties about our guide and is not part of the guide itself.
Title is simply the title of the site, `hero` is the hero id (same as file name).
`index` defines wheter the guide is shown on the site, for drafts you would set it
to `false`. There are some other fields not mentioned here, more about them later.

Everything below this block is part of the actual guide. It uses Markdown for formatting
and the ERB templating sytax for some fancier things like the summary or the
pros/cons.

#### Attribution and Ownership

Guides are not authored by a single person, but by a community. Everyone is able to
to make improvements, but we review all changes to keep the quality up.
There are plans to display the top authors of each guide,
but no promises at this point.
